### Use Case Overview
We are a data science team at Proaggresive Insurance. As an insurance company, it is often costly and time-consuming to resolve issues like insurance fraud afterwards. So it has become increasingly critical to predict and distinguish fraudulent claims leveraging predictive modelling. And we are very interested in understanding what it takes to detect insurance fraud by asking the following questions:

1. How likely is a claim fraudulent
2. What factors can be used to determine whether a claim is fraudulent or not
